Advice:
Advice represents an action taken by an aspect at a particular join point. There are different types of advices:

Before Advice: it executes before a join point.
After Returning Advice: it executes after a joint point completes normally.
After Throwing Advice: it executes if method exits by throwing an exception.
After (finally) Advice: it executes after a join point regardless of join point exit whether normally or exceptional return.
Around Advice: It executes before and after a join point.
